# Gali Home Assigment

This is my solution for the home assigment exercise, a Playwright tests written in TypeScript. 

## Prerequisites
1. Execute
   `npm i`
2. Install playwright
   `npm install playwright`
2. Create cloudinary user: \
   https://console-staging.cloudinary.com/users/register_free
3. Create .env file at the project root directory and set your-username & your-password \
   USERNAME=your-username \
   PASSWORD=your-password

## Test execution
From your project root directory run: `npx playwright test`
